Integrating Stripe payments into an ASP.NET Core web application with JavaScript involves several steps. You will need to set up a server-side API to interact with Stripe, and you'll also need to create the client-side code to handle payment processing. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to do this:


Server-Side (ASP.NET Core):

1. Create a new ASP.NET Core project: If you don't already have an ASP.NET Core project, create one using Visual Studio or the .NET CLI.

2. Install the Stripe.NET library: You can install the Stripe.NET library using NuGet Package Manager. Open a terminal and run:
```c#
[dotnet add package Stripe.net]
```

3. Configure Stripe: In your Startup.cs file, configure your Stripe API keys in the ConfigureServices method.
```c#
services.Configure<StripeSettings>(Configuration.GetSection("Stripe"));
```

4. Create a configuration section in appsettings.json:

```json
"Stripe": {
    "SecretKey": "your_secret_key",
    "PublishableKey": "your_publishable_key"
}
```
